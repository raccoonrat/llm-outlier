# **Systematic Outliers in Large Language Models: A Comprehensive Review of Their Formation, Impact, and Mitigation**

## **Introduction**

### **The Emergence of Outliers as a Critical Field of Study**

The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has marked a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence, defined by emergent capabilities that often defy simple explanation. These models, built upon the Transformer architecture, demonstrate remarkable proficiency in tasks ranging from natural language understanding to complex reasoning. However, this impressive performance is accompanied by a host of perplexing and often problematic internal behaviors.1 Among the most significant of these is the phenomenon of outliers—values within the model's activations, weights, or attention scores that deviate substantially from the typical distribution.

Initially, these outliers were perceived primarily through the lens of operational efficiency, viewed as statistical anomalies that posed a significant challenge to model compression techniques like quantization.3 The presence of these extreme values was seen as a nuisance, an impediment to deploying these massive models on resource-constrained hardware. However, a growing body of research has fundamentally reframed this understanding. Far from being random noise, outliers are now recognized as a systematic and functionally significant property of the Transformer architecture itself, a predictable byproduct of its core computational mechanisms.1 This realization has elevated the study of outliers from a niche engineering problem to a central topic in understanding the fundamental workings of LLMs.

### **Thesis Statement: From Statistical Anomaly to Functional Mechanism**

The central thesis of this review is that outliers in LLMs are not stochastic artifacts but are, in fact, *systematic outliers*—a functionally integral and predictable consequence of the self-attention mechanism's design. They represent a quintessential double-edged sword: in their native state, they appear to be essential for achieving high model performance, yet they simultaneously constitute the primary obstacle to operational efficiency, particularly for quantization-based model compression.2 This review will synthesize the current state of knowledge to argue that understanding, managing, and ultimately re-engineering the mechanisms that produce these outliers is critical for the next generation of efficient, stable, and secure LLMs.

### **Scope and Structure of the Review**

To provide a comprehensive and structured analysis, this review is organized into seven sections. Section 2 begins by establishing a foundational understanding of the phenomenon, presenting a systematic taxonomy of outliers and detailing their empirical distribution within Transformer architectures. Section 3 delves into the causal origins of these outliers, identifying the softmax operation as their root cause and exploring their functional role as implicit computational elements within the attention mechanism. Section 4 examines the wide-ranging consequences of outliers, focusing on their profound impact on model compression, training dynamics, and overall performance. Section 5 surveys the landscape of mitigation strategies, contrasting algorithmic approaches that manage outlier effects with structural solutions that aim to prevent their formation. Section 6 elevates the discussion by synthesizing these findings with broader LLM phenomena, drawing connections to activation sparsity, the mathematical structure of the Hessian matrix, and the critical domain of model privacy and security. Finally, Section 7 concludes by summarizing the state-of-the-art and charting a course for future research, identifying key open questions and promising avenues for investigation.

## **The Anatomy of Outliers in Transformer Architectures**

A deep understanding of systematic outliers begins with a precise characterization of their various forms and a detailed mapping of their prevalence within the intricate structure of LLMs. Empirical studies have moved beyond acknowledging their mere existence to systematically categorizing them and analyzing their distributional patterns, revealing a highly structured and non-random phenomenon.

### **2.1 Defining the Outlier Landscape: A Systematic Taxonomy**

The literature has converged on a taxonomy that classifies outliers into three primary types based on where they manifest within the model's computational graph.1

* **Activation Outliers:** These are extreme values observed in the activation tensors, which represent the outputs of various layers and sub-modules within the network. Activation outliers are particularly pernicious for post-training quantization (PTQ), a common model compression technique. Because quantization requires mapping a range of floating-point values to a smaller set of fixed-point integers, a single large activation value can drastically expand the required dynamic range, leading to a significant loss of precision for the majority of smaller, more common values.6  
* **Weight Outliers:** These refer to a small subset of parameters within the model's weight matrices that possess disproportionately large magnitudes. While they represent a tiny fraction of the total parameter count, research indicates that these weight outliers are often vital for maintaining model quality. For instance, recent work has identified "super weights," sometimes a single parameter, that can exert an outsized influence on a model's functionality.8  
* **Attention Outliers:** These are extreme values found within the attention score matrices computed by the self-attention mechanism. An attention outlier signifies that a particular token is receiving an overwhelming amount of focus from other tokens in the sequence, resulting in a highly skewed, non-uniform attention distribution.

The term "systematic" is crucial to this taxonomy. It underscores that these outliers are not random computational errors but are patterned phenomena that emerge consistently across different models and training runs. Their appearance is intrinsically linked to the underlying architecture and the dynamics of the training process, suggesting a deterministic origin rather than stochastic noise.1

### **2.2 Empirical Observations and Distributional Analysis**

Systematic analysis across a wide range of popular LLM families, including LLaMA, OPT, and BLOOM, has confirmed that outliers are a consistent and predictable feature, not an idiosyncrasy of a particular model or training setup.5 This research has produced a detailed map of where these outliers tend to appear.

* **Location within the Transformer Block:** Activation outliers are most heavily concentrated within the feed-forward network (FFN), also known as the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) block, that follows the self-attention sub-layer. Specifically, they are often found in the inputs to the down-projection matrices of the FFN.11 Weight outliers exhibit a similar localization, frequently appearing in these same down-projection matrices.2 Attention outliers are, by definition, located within the attention mechanism, but their intensity and distribution often show distinct, head-specific patterns, indicating specialization among the different attention heads.11  
* **Layer-wise Distribution:** The distribution of outliers is not uniform across the depth of the network. A common pattern is for activation outliers to be most prominent in the shallow and middle layers of the model. Their prevalence often changes in the final layers, suggesting that their role may be modulated as the model prepares its final output representation.2 This layered pattern further reinforces the idea that outliers are part of a structured computational process.

### **2.3 Key Properties: Asymmetry and Concentration**

Beyond their location, two key distributional properties of activation outliers have been identified as the primary reasons they are so disruptive to model compression, particularly quantization.6

* **Concentration:** Outliers are not diffusely spread across all feature dimensions. Instead, they are intensely concentrated within a very small number of specific channels. This means that out of thousands of feature dimensions in a typical LLM's hidden state, only a handful are responsible for producing these extreme values. The entire problem of an expanded dynamic range can often be traced back to these few "problematic channels".6  
* **Asymmetry:** Within these specific outlier-prone channels, the distribution of values is often highly asymmetric. For example, empirical analysis of an OPT-66B model revealed one problematic channel with values concentrated in a negative range from \-97 to \-58, while another channel exhibited outliers in a positive range from 5.7 to 43\. This asymmetry across channels can cause the overall tensor range to be significantly wider than the range of any single channel, compounding the challenge for quantization algorithms that typically assume a symmetric distribution centered around zero.10

### **2.4 Synthesis and Deeper Implications**

The highly structured, localized, and patterned nature of these outliers provides a crucial clue to their origin. The consistency of their appearance—in specific components like FFN down-projections, in particular layers, and across diverse model families—strongly suggests they are not a global failure of the model but rather a specialized, targeted mechanism. This consistency points away from explanations rooted in random artifacts of a single training run and towards a common, underlying pressure exerted by the Transformer architecture itself. If the same patterns emerge independently in different models, it stands to reason that they are a convergent solution to a shared problem posed by the architecture's design. This line of reasoning sets the stage for a deeper investigation into the fundamental mechanics of the Transformer block, specifically the self-attention mechanism, as the likely source of this systematic behavior.

## **The Genesis and Functional Role of Systematic Outliers**

Having established what outliers are and where they appear, the inquiry naturally shifts to why they exist. Recent theoretical and experimental work has provided compelling evidence that systematic outliers are not a flaw but an emergent and functionally necessary feature of the self-attention mechanism. They arise from a fundamental mathematical property of the architecture and serve a distinct, albeit counter-intuitive, purpose in model computation.

### **3.1 The Root Cause: Softmax Operation in Self-Attention**

The core theoretical breakthrough in understanding outliers identifies the softmax function, a cornerstone of the self-attention mechanism, as their fundamental generator.1 The primary role of self-attention is to dynamically weigh the importance of different tokens in a sequence relative to a given token. It achieves this by calculating attention scores and then normalizing them into a probability distribution using softmax.

The genesis of outliers lies in how softmax accomplishes this task. To create a sparse or "peaked" distribution—where attention is sharply focused on one or a few highly relevant tokens—the function must amplify small differences in its input values (the logits). When the model determines that a specific piece of contextual information is critically important, the training process pushes the corresponding logit to an extreme positive value relative to the others. This ensures that after the exponential and normalization steps of softmax, its corresponding attention weight approaches 1, while all others approach 0\. This amplification process is not an error; it is the intended and necessary function of softmax when performing sharp information selection. These extreme logit values, required for effective attention, are the initial seed of the outlier phenomenon, which then propagates throughout the network.1

### **3.2 The Lifecycle of an Outlier: A Causal Chain**

The formation of outliers is not an isolated event but a cascading process, a "lifecycle" that traces their propagation through the different components of a Transformer block.2

1. **Emergence from Weights:** The process often begins with weight outliers. Large magnitude values in the weight matrices that project inputs into queries ($W\_Q$) and keys ($W\_K$) create the potential for the dot product between a query and a key to result in an unusually large logit value.  
2. **Propagation to Attention:** These extreme logits, when fed into the softmax function, produce a highly concentrated attention distribution, creating what are defined as attention outliers.  
3. **Creation of Activation Outliers:** The output of the attention sub-layer is a weighted sum of the value vectors ($V$), where the weights are the attention scores. When an attention outlier (a score near 1\) is multiplied by its corresponding value vector, it effectively allows that value vector to pass through almost unchanged while suppressing all others. This operation, especially when aggregated across multiple attention heads, can generate large-magnitude activation outliers in the output of the attention module.  
4. **Reinforcement and Disappearance:** These activation outliers then become the input to the subsequent FFN block, potentially reinforcing the need for large weights (weight outliers) in that block as the model learns to process these high-magnitude signals. This creates a potential feedback loop. Interestingly, this process appears to be modulated in the final layers of the model, where the prevalence of certain outliers decreases, suggesting a final, task-specific refinement of the representations before the output layer.2

### **3.3 The Functional Purpose: Hypotheses and Evidence**

If outliers are a systematic and integral part of the model's computation, they must serve a functional purpose. Research has coalesced around three primary hypotheses, with mounting evidence favoring the third.2

1. **Fixed Biases:** In this view, outliers act as stable, powerful biases that consistently emphasize certain tokens or features, irrespective of the specific input context. This hypothesis is inspired by the related concept of "Massive Activations," where certain neurons fire with high intensity for specific, important concepts.2 For example, an outlier might consistently activate for punctuation or the start-of-sequence token.  
2. **Context-Aware Biases:** This hypothesis refines the first by noting that attention outliers, in particular, vary significantly depending on the input sequence. This suggests they are not fixed but act as dynamic signals that adaptively guide the model's attention based on the content of the prompt, highlighting different information as needed for the task at hand.2  
3. **Implicit, Context-Aware Scaling Factors:** This is the most compelling and somewhat counter-intuitive hypothesis. Theoretical derivations and experiments suggest that outliers function as an implicit scaling mechanism. Evidence indicates that the value vectors ($V$) corresponding to tokens that receive outlier-level attention scores often have significantly *smaller* magnitudes.1 This implies that the large attention score is not meant to amplify a signal but rather to precisely control and, in some cases, dampen the influence of certain contextual information. By creating a very sharp attention distribution, the model can effectively isolate a token and scale down its contextual updates, which helps to stabilize the network and prevent unnecessary or disruptive changes to its representation.1 In this view, extreme values are paradoxically used to achieve stability and control.

The very architecture of the Transformer creates a fundamental tension between two competing goals: *sharp information selection*, which requires a sparse, high-variance attention distribution, and *numerical stability*, which favors smaller, well-behaved value ranges. Systematic outliers appear to be the model's emergent solution to this trade-off. To perform the highly selective attention required for complex language tasks, the model must utilize the softmax function in a regime that naturally produces extreme values. These outliers are not a bug to be fixed but an inextricable feature of the selection mechanism itself. This explains why naive attempts to remove them invariably lead to a degradation in performance; doing so is akin to removing a critical gear from a finely tuned machine, disrupting a core computational strategy the model has learned to rely on.

## **Ramifications for Model Performance and Operational Efficiency**

The systematic and functional nature of outliers means their presence has profound and wide-ranging consequences. While they appear to be integral to achieving high performance, they are simultaneously the primary source of major challenges in making LLMs efficient and practical for real-world deployment. This creates a direct and quantifiable conflict between model capability and operational feasibility.

### **4.1 The Primary Obstacle to Model Compression**

The most immediate and well-documented impact of outliers is on model compression, particularly post-training quantization (PTQ).

* **The Quantization Catastrophe:** PTQ aims to reduce model size and accelerate inference by converting 32-bit or 16-bit floating-point weights and activations into low-bit integers, such as INT8 or INT4.12 This process involves defining a range and dividing it into a discrete number of quantization "bins." The presence of outliers causes a catastrophic failure of this process.2 For example, if a tensor's values are mostly within the range \[-2, 2\] but contains a single activation outlier of 100, the quantization range must be expanded to at least \[-100, 100\] to accommodate it. As a result, the vast majority of the original values in the \[-2, 2\] range are all mapped to a tiny fraction of the available quantization bins near zero. This leads to a massive loss of precision, as distinct floating-point values are collapsed into the same integer representation, severely degrading the model's performance.2 This problem is further exacerbated by the observed asymmetry of outliers, which forces the use of an even wider symmetric range and wastes a significant portion of the quantization levels.10  
* **Challenges for Pruning:** Model pruning, which seeks to improve efficiency by removing redundant weights, also faces complications from outliers.12 Magnitude-based pruning, a common approach, removes weights with small absolute values. However, the existence of weight outliers—large-magnitude parameters that are functionally critical—makes it difficult to set a global pruning threshold. A threshold set too high might erroneously remove these vital outlier weights, while a threshold set too low will fail to achieve meaningful compression. This forces a difficult trade-off that complicates the application of simple pruning strategies.2

### **4.2 Influence on Training Dynamics and Stability**

The impact of outliers extends beyond post-training efficiency and into the training process itself. Research that structurally modified the attention mechanism to prevent the formation of outliers found that these models exhibited faster convergence during the early stages of training.1

This finding suggests that a standard Transformer model must expend a significant portion of its optimization budget learning to manage and utilize these numerically extreme values. The optimization landscape may be fraught with sharp gradients and instabilities caused by these outliers, requiring the optimizer to take a more cautious and circuitous path. By designing an architecture that achieves the same function without generating outliers, the optimization problem becomes inherently easier, allowing the model to learn more quickly and stably. This implies that outliers, while functionally useful in a trained model, impose a tangible cost on the training process.

### **4.3 The Performance Cost of Naive Mitigation**

The functional importance of outliers is most starkly demonstrated by the consequences of their naive removal. A consistent finding across multiple studies is that simply clipping outliers (setting any value above a threshold to that threshold) or removing them without a more sophisticated, compensatory strategy leads to a severe degradation in model performance.2 Metrics like perplexity, a measure of how well a model predicts a sequence of text, can increase dramatically, indicating a significant loss of linguistic competence. This empirical result provides the strongest evidence against the view of outliers as mere noise. If they were simply random errors, their removal should have a neutral or even positive effect. The fact that their removal is so detrimental confirms that they are deeply embedded in the model's computational pathways and are integral to its ability to process information correctly.

The existence of systematic outliers thus creates a fundamental tension at the heart of LLM development. The very mechanisms that the model evolves to achieve high performance—namely, the sharp, selective attention distributions enabled by outliers—are the same mechanisms that make the model difficult and expensive to run efficiently on resource-constrained hardware. This is not a simple bug to be fixed but a core architectural trade-off. It frames the central challenge for researchers and engineers not as "how do we get rid of outliers?" but rather as "how can we achieve the *function* of outliers without their problematic numerical properties?" The search for an answer to this question has driven the development of a range of innovative mitigation strategies.

## **A Review of Mitigation and Management Strategies**

The recognition of outliers as a central challenge in LLM efficiency has spurred the development of various mitigation techniques. These strategies can be broadly categorized along a philosophical spectrum, from those that accept the model's native behavior and seek to manage its consequences, to those that aim to alter the model's fundamental architecture to prevent outliers from forming in the first place. This evolution reflects a growing maturity in the field's understanding of the problem.

### **5.1 The Dichotomy: Algorithmic vs. Structural Solutions**

The landscape of solutions can be divided into two main approaches:

* **Algorithmic Solutions:** These methods operate on the principle of accepting that a standard pre-trained model will generate outliers. Their goal is to mitigate the negative impact of these outliers, typically during the post-training compression phase. They are designed as "patches" or "wrappers" that can be applied to existing models to make them more amenable to techniques like quantization. These solutions treat the symptoms of the outlier problem.  
* **Structural Solutions:** These methods take a more fundamental approach, aiming to prevent the formation of outliers at their source. This involves modifying the core architecture of the model, specifically the self-attention mechanism, to achieve the desired functionality without producing extreme numerical values. These solutions treat the underlying cause of the outlier problem.

### **5.2 Case Study: The Outlier Suppression+ (OS+) Framework**

The Outlier Suppression+ (OS+) framework stands as a state-of-the-art example of an algorithmic solution designed to enable accurate post-training quantization.6 It directly targets the two key properties of activation outliers: concentration and asymmetry.

* **Core Mechanisms:**  
  * **Channel-wise Shifting:** To counteract the *asymmetry* of outliers, OS+ applies a shifting operation to each feature channel. By calculating the center of each channel's value range and shifting it towards zero, it creates a more symmetric distribution. This significantly reduces the overall tensor range required for quantization without altering the information encoded in the relative differences between values.6  
  * **Channel-wise Scaling:** To address the *concentration* of outliers in specific channels, OS+ applies a scaling factor to these problematic channels. It scales down their magnitudes to better align with the rest of the tensor, thus balancing the quantization burden and preventing a few channels from dominating the quantization range.6  
* **Equivalence and Migration:** The most innovative aspect of OS+ is its principle of mathematical equivalence. The shifting and scaling operations are not performed as extra steps during inference. Instead, their effects are algebraically "migrated" and absorbed into the weights and biases of the subsequent linear layers in the network. This means that after applying OS+, one can export a new floating-point model that is functionally identical to the original but has much weaker outliers. This new model can then be quantized effectively using standard techniques, all with *zero inference-time overhead*.6  
* **Performance:** The efficacy of this targeted approach has been demonstrated across a wide range of models. OS+ has been shown to achieve near-lossless 8-bit and 6-bit quantization on models including BERT, OPT, BLOOM, and LLaMA. For more aggressive 4-bit quantization on BERT, it established a new state-of-the-art, showcasing its superiority over previous methods.6

### **5.3 Towards Structural Elimination: Modifying the Attention Mechanism**

In contrast to the post-hoc fixes of algorithmic solutions, the structural approach seeks to redesign the attention mechanism itself. Research by An et al. (2025) has shown that the implicit scaling function performed by outliers can be replaced with an *explicit, context-aware scaling factor* incorporated directly into the attention formula.1

This modification preempts the need for the softmax function to generate extreme logit values to achieve sharp attention. By providing an explicit mechanism to control the flow of information, the model is no longer forced to discover the outlier-based strategy. The benefits of this approach are profound: it not only resolves the compression problem by preventing outlier formation but also leads to faster model convergence and improved training stability, as discussed previously.1 This demonstrates that by addressing the root cause, multiple downstream problems can be solved simultaneously.

### **5.4 Comparative Analysis of Outlier Mitigation Strategies**

The following table provides a structured comparison of the different mitigation strategies, highlighting their mechanisms, advantages, and limitations. This summary is designed to help researchers and practitioners assess the trade-offs involved in selecting an appropriate method for their specific needs and constraints.

| Strategy | Core Mechanism | Target Outlier Type | Key Advantages | Limitations & Trade-offs | Key Studies |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Algorithmic:** Outlier Suppression+ (OS+) | Channel-wise shifting & scaling to counteract asymmetry and concentration. | Activation | Achieves high-accuracy PTQ; No inference overhead; Applicable to pre-trained models. | Post-hoc fix (treats symptoms); Does not address training instability. | Wei et al. (2023) 6 |
| **Structural:** Attention Mechanism Redesign | Introducing explicit, context-aware scaling factors to replace the function of outliers. | All (prevents formation) | Solves the root cause; Accelerates convergence; Improves compression robustness. | Requires model retraining or redesign; Not a drop-in solution for existing models. | An et al. (2025) 1 |
| **Classical:** Naive Clipping/Removal | Setting a threshold and removing or saturating values beyond it. | All | Simple to implement. | Severely degrades model performance; Fails to respect the functional role of outliers. | Puccetti et al. (2021), Kovaleva et al. (2021) 2 |

### **5.5 Synthesis and Deeper Implications**

The trajectory of research on outlier mitigation mirrors a classic pattern of maturation in engineering and scientific fields. The initial, simplistic approaches, such as naive clipping, treated the problem superficially and failed because they did not respect the underlying function.2 This led to a deeper analysis of the problem's characteristics—asymmetry and concentration—which in turn enabled the development of sophisticated algorithmic patches like OS+ that work with the system's properties rather than against them.6 The final and most advanced stage is the move towards a fundamental understanding of the root cause within the architecture, leading to preventative structural redesigns.1 This progression represents a clear learning curve within the research community, moving from merely treating the symptoms to curing the underlying condition.

## **Synthesis and Connections to Broader LLM Phenomena**

The study of systematic outliers, while critical in its own right, does not exist in a vacuum. It serves as a powerful lens through which to view and connect other fundamental properties of LLMs. By examining the interplay between outliers and phenomena such as activation sparsity, the mathematical structure of the loss landscape, and even model privacy, a more unified and holistic picture of the Transformer architecture's inner workings begins to emerge. These are not disparate issues but different manifestations of the same underlying systemic dynamics.

### **6.1 Outliers and Activation Sparsity: Two Sides of the Same Coin?**

Activation sparsity is another intriguing and widely studied property of deep learning models, referring to the tendency for a large fraction of neuron activations to be zero or near-zero for any given input.14 At first glance, sparsity and outliers appear to be opposing concepts: sparsity is about the prevalence of very small values, while outliers are about the existence of very large ones. However, they can be understood as two sides of the same coin—two complementary strategies for efficient information processing.

Sparsity allows the model to be computationally efficient by effectively ignoring irrelevant information; if a neuron's activation is zero, its contribution to subsequent layers is nullified. Outliers, conversely, allow the model to place extreme importance on a small amount of critical information. Both are mechanisms for selective information routing. Research into activation sparsity has revealed "universal patterns" that mirror the findings on outliers: sparsity tends to increase with model size, and intermediate activations within the FFN layers are typically the most sparse.14 The fact that both phenomena exhibit systematic, non-random patterns suggests they are governed by the same underlying architectural principles and optimization pressures, representing two ends of the activation distribution that the model learns to precisely control.

### **6.2 Mathematical Underpinnings: The Hessian Matrix and Random Matrix Theory**

The empirical observations of outliers can be grounded in the deeper mathematical structure of the model's optimization landscape, which is described by the Hessian matrix—the matrix of second-order partial derivatives of the loss function. The structure of the Hessian provides profound insights into training dynamics and parameter interdependencies.

Recent work by Dong et al. (2025) has revealed that the Hessian's structure is shaped by a "static force" rooted in the model's architecture and a "dynamic force" that arises from the training process.16 The systematic nature of outliers can be interpreted as a direct consequence of these forces. The "static force" of the architecture may create a predisposition for certain feature dimensions or channels to be highly sensitive, making them candidates for becoming outlier channels. The "dynamic force" of training then solidifies their functional role, amplifying their magnitudes to serve a specific purpose, such as the implicit scaling discussed earlier.

Furthermore, analysis using random matrix theory has shown that the Hessian of neural networks is often near-block-diagonal, especially as the number of output classes (or, for LLMs, the vocabulary size, $C$) becomes very large.17 A block-diagonal structure implies that groups of parameters (e.g., within a layer or a neuron) are largely independent of other groups. Outliers may thus be understood as the model's mechanism for handling the rare but critically important cross-block interactions that are not captured by this dominant, decoupled structure. They are the high-cost, high-impact connections that bridge otherwise semi-independent computational modules.

### **6.3 A New Frontier: Implications for Privacy and Security**

Perhaps the most profound and forward-looking connection is the potential link between systematic outliers and model privacy. The functional role of outliers as highly specific, context-aware markers for important information makes them a prime candidate for the underlying mechanism of training data memorization.1

When an LLM memorizes a piece of sensitive data, such as personally identifiable information (PII) or a unique copyrighted sentence, it must create an internal representation that can reliably reproduce that exact sequence. It is highly plausible that the model accomplishes this by dedicating an outlier channel to that specific, rare piece of information. The extreme magnitude of the outlier would serve as a powerful and unambiguous signal to the generation process.

This hypothesis creates a powerful bridge to the field of privacy auditing. Current state-of-the-art auditing techniques rely on inserting unique data snippets called "canaries" into the training or fine-tuning data and then using membership inference attacks (MIAs) to see if the model has memorized them.20 The primary limitation of these methods is the difficulty of designing canaries that are "easy to memorize".20 The outlier framework offers a new, concrete definition for this property: an "easy-to-memorize" canary is a piece of data that is most likely to trigger the formation of a new systematic outlier during training.

This suggests a novel and potentially far more powerful method for privacy auditing. Instead of relying on black-box queries to the model's output, one could directly monitor the model's internal activations during fine-tuning. The emergence of a new, high-magnitude outlier channel that is strongly correlated with the presence of a canary in the input could serve as a direct, high-fidelity signal of memorization. This internal, "white-box" approach could lead to significantly more sensitive and reliable privacy audits than are currently possible, directly connecting the research on outlier mechanics 1 with the goals of privacy auditing.20

The study of outliers, therefore, transcends its origins in model compression. It offers a unifying perspective that links the computational strategies of the Transformer (sparsity and outliers), the mathematical realities of its optimization landscape (Hessian structure), and its most pressing societal challenges (privacy and security). These are not separate research problems but different facets of the same complex system. The mechanism the model uses for its desired function (implicit scaling) and the one it uses for its undesired behavior (privacy leakage) may be one and the same: the systematic outlier. This unified view implies that solving the outlier problem at a structural level could yield profound and perhaps unexpected benefits for building safer and more trustworthy AI systems.

## **Conclusion and Future Research Directions**

### **7.1 Summary of the State-of-the-Art**

The body of research synthesized in this review marks a significant evolution in the scientific understanding of Large Language Models. The phenomenon of outliers has been transformed from a peripheral concern for model compression into a central topic that offers deep insights into the fundamental workings of the Transformer architecture. The key takeaways are clear: outliers are not random noise but are a systematic, functionally integral, and deeply consequential property of LLMs.

They are generated by the mathematical necessities of the softmax function in the self-attention mechanism, where they serve as an emergent strategy for implicit, context-aware scaling to control information flow and stabilize representations. This functional role, however, comes at a steep price, creating the primary bottleneck for efficient model quantization and introducing complexities into the training process. The research community's response has matured from naive and ineffective removal techniques to sophisticated algorithmic fixes like OS+ that manage the symptoms, and finally to preventative structural redesigns of the attention mechanism that address the root cause. Crucially, the study of outliers provides a powerful unifying lens, connecting disparate fields of LLM research, including computational efficiency, optimization theory, and the critical domain of privacy and security.

### **7.2 Open Questions and Research Gaps**

Despite this rapid progress, several critical questions remain unanswered, defining the frontiers of future investigation.

* **Functional Trade-offs of Elimination:** While structurally eliminating outliers has shown clear benefits for compression and convergence, the full extent of the functional trade-offs is not yet known. Do these outliers play a subtle but important role in more complex, emergent capabilities like certain forms of in-context learning or abstract reasoning? A thorough investigation is needed to ensure that in solving the efficiency problem, we do not inadvertently diminish the model's most advanced capabilities.  
* **The Full Lifecycle during Pre-training:** Current analyses have largely focused on outliers in fully trained models or during short fine-tuning runs. Their lifecycle during large-scale pre-training over trillions of tokens remains a mystery. Understanding how these structures emerge, stabilize, and evolve in concert with the development of linguistic and reasoning abilities could provide unprecedented insights into the learning process itself.  
* **The Outlier-Privacy Nexus:** The proposed link between systematic outlier channels and the memorization of sensitive data is a compelling but largely theoretical hypothesis. Rigorous empirical research is urgently needed to test and validate this connection. Such work would involve fine-tuning models on datasets containing canaries and using internal probing techniques to determine if new outlier channels are indeed the primary vector for memorization. Confirming this link would have profound implications for privacy-preserving machine learning.  
* **Beyond the Transformer:** The outlier phenomenon as described is intimately tied to the softmax-based self-attention mechanism. A key open question is whether similar phenomena exist in alternative architectures that are gaining prominence, such as state-space models (e.g., Mamba) or other non-attention-based sequence models. Understanding whether this is a universal problem for large models or a uniquely Transformer-related issue is crucial for guiding future architectural innovation.

### **7.3 Future Trajectories for Research**

Based on the current state of knowledge and the identified gaps, three primary trajectories for future research appear most promising.

1. **Designing Outlier-Resistant Architectures:** The most impactful avenue for future work lies in the continued development of novel attention mechanisms and alternative architectures that fulfill the requirement of selective, dynamic information routing without the side effect of generating numerically problematic outliers. This involves moving beyond patching the existing softmax mechanism and exploring fundamentally new ways to compute contextual importance, potentially leading to models that are inherently more stable, efficient, and easier to train.  
2. **Unified Optimization Frameworks:** The current paradigm often treats model performance, efficiency, and safety as separate objectives to be optimized sequentially (e.g., train for performance, then quantize for efficiency, then align for safety). Future research should focus on creating unified frameworks that co-optimize for these goals simultaneously. In such a framework, outlier management would be a central pillar, not an afterthought, with the optimization process directly penalizing the formation of numerically unstable structures while rewarding functional effectiveness and privacy preservation.  
3. **Outlier-Based Interpretability Tools:** If outlier channels are indeed the model's way of flagging what it deems most important, then they represent a powerful signal for interpretability. Future work could focus on developing tools to automatically identify, visualize, and analyze the behavior of these outlier channels. Such tools could allow researchers to ask, for any given input, "What information did the model consider critical?" The answers could provide unprecedented insights into the model's decision-making process, helping to debug errors, understand biases, and ultimately build more transparent and reliable AI systems.
